# SOLID principle

## Single Resposilbity Principle (SRP)
This principle states that ```a class should have only one reason to change``` which means every class should have a single responsibility or single job or single purpose.

## Open Closed 
This principle states that ```software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.)``` should be open for extension, but closed for modification” which means you should be able to extend a class behavior, without modifying it.

## Liskov Substitution
This principle states that ```Derived or child classes must be substitutable for their base or parent classes```. In other words, if class A is a subtype of class B, then we should be able to replace B with A without interrupting the behavior of the program.
